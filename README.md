This repository is dedicated to the optimization of optimal power flow (OPF) in grid-connected systems, with a focus on enhancing efficiency, reliability, and grid stability. The project encompasses modeling, algorithm development, and simulations to address key challenges such as load balancing and renewable energy integration.

**Key Features**
Optimal Power Flow (OPF): Efficient algorithms to optimize power distribution.
Grid Stability: Methods to ensure reliable operation under varying load demands.
Renewable Energy Integration: Tailored solutions for incorporating renewable sources.

**Dependencies**
This project utilizes the OPTI optimization toolbox (https://github.com/jonathancurrie/OPTI), a powerful tool for solving linear, nonlinear, and mixed-integer optimization problems.
